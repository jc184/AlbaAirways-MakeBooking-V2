# AlbaAirways-MakeBooking-V2
A shopping cart based e-commerce flight booking system in Java and JSP that uses transactions, TLS and PayPal for the secure creation of bookings and registration of customers for a fictitious regional Scottish airline. Allows a user to select desired outbound and return Flights and book seats on both during the Booking process, which proceeds to the logging in and registration of new customers using TLS. This process features a JTA transaction that saves Customer, Booking and Seating data to a MySQL database that the author of this web application also designed and developed as part of a Open University MSc Computing (Software Engineering) module in Software Development.
